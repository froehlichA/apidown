- adding documentation

## Solving issues
Regardless if you are writing code or documentation, please state that you are currently working on the issue.

### Writing Code
When writing code, first check existing code for general guidelines.
- we are currently using callbacks instead of promises, although that could change in the near future.
- Remember to add unit tests. If you have been working on ```[file]```, write your tests into ```[file].index.js```. Pull requests without added unit tests will not be accepted.
- If you have added a new feature, document it immediately, or attach the label "documentation needed" to your issue.

### Writing documentation
Make sure that the feature you are trying is document isn't already documented, and place your docs in the right file:
- General documentation in the README.md file.
- Info about contributing to the project in the CONTRIBUTING.md file.
- Info about the app itself and app functions and method in the 'Documentation' Section of the README.md file.

## Adding new ideas
Before adding your idea, check if
- it is already present in code
- it is already present as an issue

If you found nothing, create a new issue describing:
- What idea you have, as the description.
- A summary of your idea, as the title.

Then, please refer to 'Writing code'.

## Adding documentation
Refer to 'Adding new ideas' and 'Writing documentation'.
